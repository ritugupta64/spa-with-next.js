00:00:48.750 --> 00:01:03.180
Mr. Potter it seems only yesterday that

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:15.710
your mother and father were in here

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:15.710
buying their first ones yeah

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:49.259
give it away currently not perhaps this

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:18.249

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:51.460
yes very sorry but what's curious I

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:55.080
remember every one I've ever sold mr.

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:57.930
Potter it so happens that the Phoenix

00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:04.360
whose tail feather resides in your wand

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:06.880
gave another feather just one other it

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:11.410
is curious that you should be destined

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:19.650
for this wand when it's brother gave you

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:19.650
that scar and who owned that wand

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:27.409
we do not speak his name the wand

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:33.110
chooses the wizard mr. Potter it's not

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:37.390
always clear why but I think it is clear

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:43.010
that we can expect great things from you

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:44.980
after all he who must not be named did

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:52.750
